        “Everything is seen only when light enters our eyes. But there are some
        things we can see even without this entry of light. Our dreams and
        mental images.”

          Phosphenes are the luminous floating stars, zigzags, swirls, spirals,
          squiggles, and other shapes that you see when closing your eyes tight
          and pressing them with your fingers. ... These flashes of colorful
          light that are produced from inside the eye rather than from an
          outside light source.
        </div>
        “an impression of light that occurs without light entering the eye”
        <div>
          The word phosphene comes from the Greek words phōs (light) and
          phainein (to show). Our firm is the source of ‘light to show’ your
          mental images and design them into a concrete reality. We focus on
          pragmatic design, in an approach of experiential space planning with a
          parametric touch, to create climate responsive sustainable habitable
          structures with comfort and aesthetics. Our Integrated architectural
          approach ranges from residential, commercial, hospitality, industrial
          and high-rise designs with elegant interiors and landscapes.
